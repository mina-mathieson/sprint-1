Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
The command line is like a set of shorthand instructions to navigate your way around a computer.
 List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.
 1. pwd print working directory to find YOU ARE HERE.  This helps you locate where you are right at this moment.
2. cd means to change the directory (from the one you are in)
3. cd ~ means to not only change the directory but take me back to home base while you're at it.   This command takes you back to your starting point from where ever you currently are.   
4. When used with pwd cd ~ it will print the working directory of your home base
5. mkdir make directory - this command makes a folder.  It can have sub folders within it which create a pathway to navigate the stems and branches of folders within a directory. 
6. hostname is the name of my computer's network
7. cat print the whole file - what ever is in it
8. find is a good self-explanatory command.  It simply means to find files
9. grep command means to search and find things within folders themselves.
10. ls means to list the directory
